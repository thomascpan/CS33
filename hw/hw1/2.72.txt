A.
size_t is an unsigned int.
maxbytes is a signed int.
A signed int is converted to an unsigned int when an expression contains both unsigned and signed ints. 
Because the result will be unsigned, maxbytes-sizeof(val) can never be below 0.

B.
void copy_int(int val, void *buf, int maxbytes) {
	// sizeof(val) to signed int to allow for negative numbers.
	if (maxbytes-(signed int)sizeof(val) >= 0)
		memcpy(buf, (void *) &val, sizeof(val));
}

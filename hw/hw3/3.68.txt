str1:
	Size of x has to be between 180 and 184 due to y's alignment.

str2:
	Size of B has to be between 5 and 8 due to t's alignment. 
	Size of A has to be between 7 and 10 due to u's alignment.

184/4 = 46. 
Since 46 does not have a factor between 5 and 8 and between 7 and 10,
x must have a size of 180.
180/4 = 45
Since 45 is divisible by 9 and 5, A must equal 9 and B must equal 5.
